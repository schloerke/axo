  <h3 style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Star Booth of Alpha Chi Omega is a Convention tradition that provides an opportunity for 
    you to recognize the special people in your life while supporting Alpha Chi Omega. With each 
    $10 gift to Delta Nuâ€™s "Building Real. Strong. Women." campaign, you make a "Star" of a 
    special friend. If you are unable to attend, please remember special sisters, friends, and loved 
    ones with a designated gift in their honor.</h3>  
    <br />
  <h3 style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honorees attending the 50th Anniversary will receive special stars to wear on their nametags. If 
    honorees are not attending the 50th Anniversary, they will be notified by e-mail (preferable) or 
    mail of your gift in their honor. All donors and honorees will be recognized in the Delta Nu "Sky 
    of Fame" at the Star Booth during the weekend.</h3>
